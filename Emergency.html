    <h3>3. What is it???</h3>
    <b>Explanation</b>: <br><br> 
          This app is for anyone in various cricumstances to get help during school energencies. It also allows for mass notification if what were considered “safe areas” during practice emergency procedures have been compromised. In addition, it can alos help with out of school emergencies like stalking, fires, intruders, etc. It has a ome page that leads you to sign up/login, and if you sign-up/login as a student you gets redirected to main page. This page has four main features: Dialing 911, sending a text to selected people, indicating safe areas to selected people, and sending your location to selected people. In contrast, if you sign-up/login as an admin you can see all the user information and sent all messages

        <h3>4. What I learned</h3>
        <b>Skills</b>: <br><br> 
              1. This app gave me experience in using APIs, and being put into situations where I have to store major amounts of data, a skill which became exceedingly more important in later projects. <br><br> 
       2.This was the first big app we did, that required a very clear use interface. Even though the interface wasn't hard code, it was still very important to identify what is easy for a user to understand versus what isnt.
